### Welcome!
I am a creative coder who enjoys exploring the intersection of art and technology, with a particular focus on AV performance and interactivity using Python, Touchdesigner, and Ableton. I have a strong interest in data-driven art and enjoy experimenting with generative processes.

Please get in touch if you are interested or have any questions about my projects or just want to chat!
